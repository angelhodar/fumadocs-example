*   **Category:** each technology belongs to a category. One category groups more than one technology, typically
*   **Jobs:** the number of jobs where each company has mentioned each technology
*   **Ocurrence within category:** shows how common one technology is compared to other technologies in the same category, for each company
*   **Theirstack Score:** a metric that combines **jobs** and **relative occurrance within category.** The idea is that the more jobs a company has mentioning a technology, and the more one technology is mentioned VS similar ones in the same category, the more likely is that the company uses this technology.
*   **Rank within category:**  if a company mentions 3 technologies of a category in their jobs, the most frequent one will have rank 1, and the least frequent one in their jobs rank 3

Besides these, there are other columns whose names are self-explanatory: **Company size, Company Industry, Company Country and more**

### Step 3. Seeing the sources of our data

By clicking on the number of jobs found mentioning that technology, you will be able to check the job postings were this technology was mentioned
