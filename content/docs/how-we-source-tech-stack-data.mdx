We source our tech usage data from job postings. We gather job listings from millions of companies monthly by tracking company websites, job boards, and other hiring platforms.

When a job mentions a specific technology, either in the title or description, it hints the company is using that technology. Our Confidence Score (low, medium, high), which considers both the number of mentions and its frequency relative to similar technologies in the category, helps us estimate how likely it is that a company actually uses this technology.

When you're in a [company search](https://app.theirstack.com/search/companies/new?query=JTdCJTIybmFtZSUyMiUzQSUyMkNvbXBhbmllcyUyMiUyQyUyMmF1dG9fc2VhcmNoJTIyJTNBdHJ1ZSUyQyUyMmRyYWZ0X21vZGUlMjIlM0F0cnVlJTJDJTIycXVlcnklMjIlM0ElN0IlMjJwYWdlJTIyJTNBMCUyQyUyMmxpbWl0JTIyJTNBMTAlMkMlMjJjb21wYW55X3RlY2hub2xvZ3lfc2x1Z19vciUyMiUzQSU1QiUyMnNhbGVzZm9yY2UlMjIlNUQlMkMlMjJjb21wYW55X2NvdW50cnlfY29kZV9vciUyMiUzQSU1QiUyMkVTJTIyJTVEJTJDJTIyb3JkZXJfYnklMjIlM0ElNUIlN0IlMjJmaWVsZCUyMiUzQSUyMm51bV9qb2JzJTIyJTJDJTIyZGVzYyUyMiUzQXRydWUlN0QlNUQlN0QlN0Q=) filtering by some technologies, we show cards highlighting the technologies they use that overlap with the ones you're filtering by
