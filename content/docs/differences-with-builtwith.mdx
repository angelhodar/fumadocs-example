Our approach to sourcing tech usage data sets us apart from BuiltWith in a few key ways. First, we offer a broader technology catalog that includes not only web technologies but also CRMs, ERPs, databases, and various internal tools. BuiltWith focuses solely on web technologies.

Additionally, instead of tracking websites, we gather data from job postings. Each month, we collect job listings from millions of companies by monitoring company websites, job boards, and other hiring platforms. When a job listing mentions a specific technology in the title or description, it indicates that the company likely uses that technology. We then assign a Confidence Score (low, medium, high) based on the frequency and context of these mentions to estimate how likely the company is to use that technology.

Our pricing model is also unique. While BuiltWith charges based on technology reports, we base our pricing on the number of companies returned in your search.
