Introduction
------------

There are some actions (such as exporting data, adding companies to lists, or finding contact data) you may want to run on many companies, potentially much larger than TheirStack's default page size (25 records per page).

Here we show you how to select hundreds or even thousands of records at once.

Step by step
------------

On a company or job search page, click on the checkbox that appears in the top left corner of the table:

Set the number of results you want to select and click on **Apply**

If this is the case, you'll see a confirmation window informing you of the amount of credits you'd spend.

Click on **Continue** and a small pop up will be shown in the middle of the screen with a progress bar. We'll make searches in the background to collect all the companies selected.

This is done for performance reasons (some browsers would get too slow if we tried to load thousands of records on the table).

The bulk actions you run will act on all the selected rows, even the ones not shown on the page.
