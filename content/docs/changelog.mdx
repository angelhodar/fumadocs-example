## January 14, 2025

-   🆕 **New filter `job_seniority_or` in our [Jobs API](https://api.theirstack.com/#tag/jobs/POST/v1/jobs/search)**. This filter allows you to search for jobs by seniority level.

-   🆕 **Shortened URL detection for new jobs and companies**. Our system now identifies shortened URLs (e.g., `bit.ly`, `tinyurl`, etc.) for newly discovered jobs and companies. Instead of storing the shortened URL in our database, we now retrieve and save the original URL.

-   🐞 **Fixed an issue causing duplicate job postings**. A job is considered a duplicate if the same company posts the same job title within a 30-day window. Previously, the system identified duplicates by checking job postings from the past 30 days, instead of 30 days before and after the posting date. As a result, jobs posted more than 30 days ago were not flagged as duplicates when found again by our system.

-   🐞 **Fixed Make.com button**. The Make.com button, which lets you copy a Make scenario that calls our API, was not authenticating correctly.

## January 10, 2025

This field indicates whether the job application can be submitted directly through the job board (`easy_apply=True`) or requires redirecting to the company's website (`easy_apply=False`). Initially, this field will be populated for new jobs sourced from LinkedIn and Indeed.
