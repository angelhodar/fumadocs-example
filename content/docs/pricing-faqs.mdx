Why can't I see a company that was previously unblurred?
--------------------------------------------------------

When you reveal a company, a company credit is used. This allows you to view all their jobs, technologies, and firmographics, or export that company as many times as you want for 90 days.

Since collecting new jobs or technologies incurs a cost, it's not feasible to offer unlimited access to new data indefinitely.

However, we are planning an enhancement to offer you a better experience: after 90 days, you will still be able to see the company, but any new jobs or technologies discovered after that period will not be accessible. This ensures you retain the data you've paid for, without receiving updates beyond the initial access period.
