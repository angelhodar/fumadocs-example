At TheirStack, we prioritize the privacy and data protection rights of individuals. We are committed to ensuring that our job scraping practices are fully compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Our approach to data scraping is governed by the following principles:

1.  **Lawful Basis for Processing**: TheirStack.com only scrapes job data where there is a legitimate interest or other lawful basis, as permitted under GDPR. We obtain consent where necessary and ensure that our practices are transparent and fair.
2.  **Transparency and Fairness**: We are dedicated to clear and open communication about our data collection processes. Our privacy notice and policy detail our scraping activities and explain how the data will be used, ensuring that users are well-informed.
3.  **Data Minimization**: We adhere to the principle of data minimization by collecting only the information necessary for the purpose of providing accurate and relevant job listings. We avoid gathering excessive personal information that is not pertinent to the job postings.
4.  **Data Security**: Protecting the data we collect is paramount. TheirStack.com employs robust security measures to safeguard the data from unauthorized access, breaches, and other security threats.
5.  **Data Subject Rights**: We respect the rights of individuals as outlined in the GDPR. This includes the right to access, rectify, and erase their personal data. We provide mechanisms for individuals to easily exercise these rights.
6.  **Regular Audits and Compliance Checks**: To maintain our commitment to GDPR compliance, TheirStack.com conducts regular audits of our scraping activities. We continuously review and update our practices to ensure they remain aligned with GDPR requirements and reflect any regulatory changes.

By adhering to these principles, we ensure that our job scraping practices are conducted responsibly and in full compliance with GDPR, upholding the highest standards of data protection and privacy.
